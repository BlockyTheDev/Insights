# This is an example limit for tiles. Users will be able to only place at most 256 tiles per chunk.
# The limit makes use of a world blacklist, which means with the current configuration it will work for all worlds.
# It will also work for all addons.
# The limit will also be applied on WorldEdit modifications, which means that the user won't be able to place tiles through WorldEdit.
